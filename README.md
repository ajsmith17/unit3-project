I took care of most the CSS and HTML. My preplanning started about a week before the groups were assigned. I knew it would be a full CRUD app with angular, so I took a little time thinking about what kind of sites would use all 7 RESTful routes. I too inspiration in design from maxrichtermusic.com in the over all wireframe. I liked the minimal framing and few steps it took to get where you wanted. I followed that design lead with a color palette I pulled from Pinterest (Yes, its a great resource!). I wanted my colors to be thematically consistent with photos a gathered from a friend's website blog, so I settled on cru, gold, brown and deep navy. I LOVED Marcos' design with his last project with the looping background video, so I reached out to him and he shared a resources that taught me to build it. I chose drone footage that I pulled from youtube of the NYC skyline because I felt it spoke to the travel blog theme. Lastly, I went for the logo. Fortunately, a friend was willing to give me permission for their yoga studio logo. I used the logo for my primary insignia and favicon.
